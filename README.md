# Fall-Detection
Human Fall Detection via Webcam

## Requirements
1. MATLAB - R2019b or higher
2. MATLAB Toolboxes:
   <br>a. Image Acquisition Toolbox
   <br>b. Image Processing Toolbox
   <br>c. Computer Vision Toolbox

## Execution
Run 'falldetection_via_webcam.m' .
This would read 'video.mp4' and detect the falling action of a human in that video.
An e-mail alert would be send to user after fall detection.

## Modification
To edit sender's and receiver's email addresses (and password and message), modify 'sendemail.m' .
